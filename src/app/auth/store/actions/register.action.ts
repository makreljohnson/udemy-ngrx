* Hi Seeschon, I'm using props aliases as I want to see when it's an
* input and not a local property. If you want object or array and mutate
* it in child component then it will be also changed in parent.
* This behaviour is difficult to debug. In the case with props I see that
* it's an input and never mutate it (exactly like in Vue and React)

	a strongly typed props function takes care of adding properties without old fashioned payload
